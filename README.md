# Spring web shop 

Temporary mess in code.<br>

Future frameworks for basic version :
- Spring Data
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- JSP/JSTL

Project will include :
  - User login/registration with e-mail informations
  - websites for users (books categories, books, specific book)
  - Possibility to buy products or add to account(books) with e-mail informations
  - Administrator side to manage
    - books(pictures & categories)
    - users account(block, delete...)
    - all orders(old, to realise..)
  
After basic version, I will add bootstrap with js and modify views.
